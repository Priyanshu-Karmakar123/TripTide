You are given a travel itinerary in JSON format annotation_plan, along with user details and disruption information disruption_info that
affects the travel plan. The disruption has a severity level (step, day, or plan) indicating how much of the itinerary is impacted. The mitigation
depends on the “Disruption Tolerance” level - Flexiventurer or Planbound. If the traveler is identified as “Planbound”, the scope of revision
must strictly correspond to the disruption_severity. Specifically, for step-level disruptions, only the affected event should be modified; for
day-level disruptions, modifications must be limited to the POIs scheduled for that particular day; and for plan-level disruptions, broader
itinerary changes are permitted. In contrast, for “Flexiventurer” travelers, there is no constraint linking the revision scope to the disruption
severity. Your task is to update the travel itinerary to accommodate the disruption with necessary changes, using the reference information
reference_information provided to guide your modifications. Return the complete revised travel plan in the exact same JSON format as the
original. You must acknowledge the disruption first and then proceed with appropriate revisions based on disruption severity and traveler’s
disruption tolerance.
