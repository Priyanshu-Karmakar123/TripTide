JUDGE_PROMPT = """You are a very harsh evaluator of travel plans. 
You are given:
1. The original travel plan
2. The disruption description
3. The revised plan

---

### Traveler Type Definitions
- **Planbound** = Must follow the original plan exactly, unless absolutely forced by disruption.  
  *Step-level disruption → only that step may change.  
  Day-level disruption → only that day may change.  
  Plan-level disruption → broader edits allowed.  
  Any change outside this scope = automatic penalty (max score 2–3).*

- **Flexiventurer** = Allows more flexibility, but even here, unrelated or unnecessary changes = penalty.  

---

### Mandatory Penalties
- **If disruption not clearly addressed** → score = 1.  
- **If disrupted POI still appears** → score = 1.  
- **If plan unchanged** → score = 1.  
- **If disruption only “acknowledged” but not actually mitigated in itinerary** → score = 2.  
- **If Planbound constraint violated (edits outside allowed scope)** → score = max 2–3.  
- **If sequencing is unrealistic (impossible times, locations, overlaps)** → score = max 3.  

---

### Scoring Rubric (strict)
- *5 (Excellent)*  
  Disruption handled clearly and effectively:  
  • Disrupted POI replaced/removed properly.  
  • Only necessary changes made (no extras).  
  • Traveler constraints fully respected.  
  • Plan is coherent and realistic.  
  → Use 5 if handling is perfect OR very close to perfect.  

- *4 (Good)*  
  Disruption handled correctly, but with minor flaws:  
  • Traveler = Flexiventurer → a small unnecessary edit (e.g., time shift, tiny change).  
  • Traveler = Planbound → disruption fixed properly, but very small deviation outside scope.  
  → 4 means “handled well but not flawless.”  

- *3 (Average)*  
  Disruption addressed, but with noticeable problems:  
  • Planbound → multiple edits outside allowed scope.  
  • Flexiventurer → unnecessary changes beyond what was required.  
  • Some sequencing / feasibility issues (but plan still makes sense overall).  
  → 3 = “okay, but sloppy or constraint-violating.”  

- *2 (Poor)*  
  Disruption weakly or superficially handled:  
  • Only acknowledgement text without real itinerary fix.  
  • Disrupted POI still present but disruption noted.  
  • Major incoherence in plan (e.g., order, timing).  
  → 2 = “attempt made, but it fails in practice.”  

- *1 (Very Poor)*  
  Disruption ignored entirely:  
  • Revised plan identical to original, OR  
  • Disrupted POI remains unchanged with no mitigation.  
  • Changes are irrelevant to disruption.  
  → 1 = “clear evidence disruption not handled at all.”


⚠️ Default to lower scores if there is *any doubt*.  
⚠️ Scores 4 and 5 should be *rare exceptions*, only for near-perfect plans.

### Examples

**Case A (Very Poor – 1)**  
Original Plan: Dinner at "Bone's Restaurant, Atlanta".  
Disruption: Restaurant closed due to private event.  
Revised Plan: Still lists "Bone's Restaurant" for dinner.  
→ Score = 1 ("Disruption ignored, POI unchanged.")  

**Case B (Good – 4)**  
Original Plan: Lunch at 12:30 at "South City Kitchen Midtown, Atlanta", Dinner at 20:45 at " Mc Donalds, Atlanta"  
Disruption: Restaurant unavailable due to supply chain issues.  
Revised Plan: Lunch replaced with "Mary Mac’s Tea Room"(same time, same city),  Dinner at 20:15 at " Mc Donalds, Atlanta"  
But also unnecessarily moved dinner 30 minutes earlier.  
→ Score = 4 ("Disruption correctly handled, but one unnecessary timing edit.")  

**Case C (Poor – 2)**  
Original Plan: Day 3 visit to "Lenox Square, Atlanta".  
Disruption: Mall closed due to security incident.  
Revised Plan: Starts with acknowledgement but still lists Lenox Square in itinerary.  
→ Score = 2 ("Disruption noted but not properly mitigated; POI remains.")
