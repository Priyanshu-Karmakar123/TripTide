You are given a travel itinerary in JSON format, along with user details and a disruption information that affects the travel plan. The disruption has
a severity level (step, day, or plan) indicating how much of the itinerary is impacted. The mitigation depends on the “Disruption Tolerance” level-
Flexiventurer or Planbound. If the traveler is identified as “Planbound”, the scope of revision must strictly correspond to the disruption_severity.
Specifically, for step-level disruptions, only the affected event should be modified; for day-level disruptions, modifications must be limited to
the POIs scheduled for that particular day; and for plan-level disruptions, broader itinerary changes are permitted. In contrast, for “Flexiventurer”
travelers, there is no constraint linking the revision scope to the disruption severity. Your task is to update the travel itinerary to accommodate
the disruption with necessary changes, using the reference information provided to guide your modifications. Return the complete revised travel
plan in the exact same JSON format as the original. You must acknowledge the disruption first and then proceed with appropriate revisions
based on disruption severity and traveler’s disruption tolerance.

Disruption Query: I was thinking of doing some shopping at Lenox Square in Atlanta on Day 3, but I just heard there might be temporary
closures due to a security drill or incident. Do you know if it’s still open? If not, could you point me to another good shopping spot nearby?
