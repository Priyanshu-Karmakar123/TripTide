Instruction: You are an efficient AI agent to generate user query in natural language. You are given the following travel disruption
information including disruption category, reason, disruption timestamp and disruption severity. Convert it into a travel disruption query
by a user, which is a natural language query for the disruption information. The query should not include information like disruption
severity that is unknown to a traveler and should be as natural as possible. The query must also ask for alternative options.

Output:
Hey, I had planned to have lunch at Thames Street Oyster House on
